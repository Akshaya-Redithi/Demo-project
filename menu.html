Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.The quality of your life is directly related to how much uncertainty you can comfortably handle.A happy life consists in the tranquility of mind.Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re going to get.
